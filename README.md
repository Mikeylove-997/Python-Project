Explore how financial factors like income, economic performance, and the volatility of the financial market affect heart disease death rate in the United States. Our goal is to identify if better health outcomes are associated with financial stability and well-being, or conversely, if financial instability could lead to a higher death rate.

H1: County-level economic stress—measured by GDP growth, unemployment, and uninsured rates—is linked to age-adjusted heart-disease mortality in the U.S.
H1 Key finding: Among the three economic indicators, unemployment consistently shows the strongest and clearest relationship with heart-disease mortality. In contrast, the local uninsured rate and GDP growth are weakly associated with mortality.

H2: Counties (or states) with higher median household income have lower age-adjusted heart disease mortality rates.
H2 Key Finding: Across states, counties, and national data, higher median income is strongly associated with lower heart-disease mortality, making income a powerful financial predictor in our study.

H3: Greater exposure to market volatility is linked to bigger rises in heart-disease mortality during economic crises.
H3 Key Finding: Economic shocks create volatility, but heart-disease mortality does not automatically spike. Risk depends more on baseline vulnerability (existing health conditions, pre-crisis mortality) and the severity of the local unemployment shock.
